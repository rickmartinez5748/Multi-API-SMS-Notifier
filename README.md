# Themed SMS Sender â€“ Flask Web App

This is a fun Flask web application that simulates sending SMS messages by randomly selecting content from one of three themed modules:

- A greeting from a real astronaut in space  
- A message from a fictional Harry Potter character  
- The current weather in Sudbury, Canada  

## How It Works

When the user clicks the **Send Message** button on the web page:

1. The app randomly selects one of the three themed message generators.
2. It sends the message content (simulated SMS) and displays a success flash message.
3. The generated message is also logged in a `log.txt` file for record-keeping.
