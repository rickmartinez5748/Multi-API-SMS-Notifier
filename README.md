# Themed SMS Sender â€“ Flask Web App

This web app uses Flask to combine data from three different APIs into a custom notification message, which is then sent via Twilio SMS. I also created a simple front-end interface to trigger messages with a single click. This project was designed to demonstrate how various services can work together to automate updates and alerts. It showcases integration skills and practical automation using REST APIs.

## How It Works

When the user clicks the **Send Message** button on the web page:

1. The app randomly selects one of the three themed message generators.
2. It sends the message content (simulated SMS) and displays a success flash message.
3. The generated message is also logged in a `log.txt` file for record-keeping.
